    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The Germans refer to the Armistice negotiations as
    <i>Waffenstillstandeverhandlungen</i>. We hope it will be worse
    even than they think.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is no truth in the rumour that among the many new
    performances of <i>Hamlet</i> which are promised there will be
    one in aid of the fund for brightening the lives of the clergy,
    with the Gloomy Dean as the Gloomy Dane.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"We Americans do not consider ourselves the salt of the
    earth," says Senator HENRY. No, but their bacon certainly
    is.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In view of the fact that there is a large quantity of
    marmalade in the country, it has been decided to release it.
    This is such a satisfactory solution of the problem that people
    are wondering whether the Food Ministry thought of that one
    themselves.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Our heart goes out to the soldier who, when offered, on
    demobilisation, the option of fifty-two shillings and sixpence
    or a standard suit, replied that he would rather pay the
    fine.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The only surprising thing about Mr. C.B. COCHRAN'S proposal
    for a Peace Fair in Hyde Park, to be arranged largely by
    himself, is that there is no mention of a Serpentine dance for
    DELYSIA.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Australian Government proposes to send returned
    Australian soldiers to prospect for minerals in the Northern
    Territories. Whether they will be interested in them after
    their experience in England in failing to locate quarts is
    another matter.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Sir EDWARD ELGAR has dedicated his new orchestral work,
    "Polonia," to M. PADEREWSKI. The report that the distinguished
    pianist-politician is thinking of retorting with a fugue,
    "Stiltonia," is not confirmed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Aircraft Salvage branch announces that not less than one
    thousand five hundred yards of the aeroplane linen which is
    being disposed of to the public will be sold to one purchaser.
    In the event of the purchaser deciding to use it as a
    pocket-handkerchief he can have it hemstitched for a trifling
    sum.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Improvement is reported in the condition of the taxi-cab
    driver who had a seizure in Piccadilly Circus while attempting
    to say "Thank you" to a fare.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are pleased to be able to announce that the Kensington
    man who last week managed to board a tube train has consented
    to write a book about it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Writing to a contemporary a Leeds correspondent says that he
    does not think much of an inactive corporation. As a matter of
    fact, since the introduction of rationing we didn't think
    active ones were being worn.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>As a result of munition work, says a health journal, quite a
    number of men have given up smoking tobacco. We suppose the
    theory is that they have now taken to smoking threepenny
    cigars.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mrs. MAGGIE HATHWAY of Montana is to be congratulated upon
    running a six-hundred-acre farm without the help of men's
    labour. After all we men must admit that her sporting effort is
    a distinct score for the second oldest sex in the world.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Anglesea Police Commission are offering one shilling and
    sixpence a dozen for rats' tails to residents of the county.
    Some difficulty is expected in distinguishing local from
    imported tails once they are separated from the rat.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In connection with the offers for Drury Lane Theatre it
    appears that one of the would-be purchasers declares that he
    was more syndicate than sinning.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In connection with the epidemic of burglaries in London,
    <i>The Daily Express</i> has now published a leader note saying
    there have been too many of late. It is hoped that this will
    have the desired effect.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are glad to report that the gentleman who, at the BURNS
    festival, upon being asked if he would take a little haggis
    replied that he wouldn't mind trying a wing, managed to escape
    with his life.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A West Hampstead architect has designed a cottage in which
    there will be no bricks in the walls, no timber in the roof, no
    slates or tiles and no register grates. Too late.
    Jerry-builders accomplished that trick years ago.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>While walking in Highams Park, Chingford, says a
    contemporary, a postman picked up a package containing one
    ounce of butter. To his eternal credit let it be said that he
    at once took it to the nearest police station.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The best brains of the country are still exercised by the
    alleged need of brightening cricket. One of our own suggestions
    is that the bowler should be compelled to do three Jazz-steps
    and two Fox-trots before delivering the ball.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A typist recently fell from a moving train on the Isle of
    Wight railway, but was able to get up and walk towards her
    destination. We hear she had a good deal to say to the guard
    when she overtook the train.</p>

    <h2>EVICTED.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A common scandal, inviting the attention of the
    Government.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I was amazed the other day to hear that my landlord had
    called to see me. Hitherto our intercourse had been by letter
    and we had had heated differences on the subject of repairs.
    His standpoint seemed to be that landlords were responsible for
    repairs only to lightning conductors and weathercocks. My house
    possesses neither of these desirable adjuncts.</p>

    <p>I moved an armchair so that no one sitting in it could fail
    to see the dampest wall and ordered him to be shown in.</p>

    <p>He was a most benevolent-looking old gentleman, and I felt I
    had done him an injustice in regarding him as a property
    shark.</p>

    <p>"Glad to see you," he said, shaking me warmly by the
    hand.</p>

    <p>"Do sit down," I said. "That chair is the most comfortable.
    Don't be afraid. At that distance from the wall the damp won't
    affect you."</p>

    <p>"So glad to see how comfortable you are here," said the
    benevolent one.</p>

    <p>"If we could occasionally have a hot bath we should be more
    comfortable, but the kitchen range is impossible."</p>

    <p>"What you need, my friend, is a house of your own so that
    you can adapt it to your own ideas. How would you like this
    house?"</p>

    <p>My breath was taken away. Had the kindly one come to present
    me with a house? Was I to be the object of an amiable
    plutocrat's benevolence?</p>

    <p>"I should like it very much," I said.</p>

    <p>"You shall have it," he said, slapping me amiably on the
    knee.</p>

    <p>I gasped for breath. In my time I had had boxes of cigars
    given me, but never houses.</p>

    <p>"For fifteen hundred pounds, as you are the tenant,"
    continued the benevolent one.</p>

    <p>I gasped for breath again.</p>

    <p>"But you bought it for five hundred and fifty pounds just
    before the War," I said when I had recovered.</p>

    <p>"Ah, before the War," chuckled the philanthropist.</p>

    <p>"I don't think I can afford fifteen hundred pounds."</p>

    <p>The benevolent one looked disappointed in me. "Dear me," he
    said, "and I wanted so much to sell it to you. Well, I shall
    have to give you notice to quit in June. This house must be
    sold."</p>

    <p>"But I can't get another house."</p>

    <p>"You can have this house. But surely you have some friend
    who will advance you fifteen hundred pounds?"</p>

    <p>"You don't know my friends. It would be very awkward to be
    turned into the street."</p>

    <p>"You should have a house of your own and be independent.
    Every man should own his home. Now can't you think of some
    friend who could assist you?"</p>

    <p>"Could you lend me fifteen hundred pounds for a rather
    speculative investment?" I inquired.</p>

    <p>"Since my kindly consideration for a tenant is treated with
    mockery I give you written notice to leave. A 'For Sale' board
    will be placed in your garden. A clause in the lease authorises
    me to do that. I wish you good morning."</p>

    <p>Well, I am to be evicted, and, as I'm not an Irishman, no
    one will care. I shall not lie in wait with a shot-gun for my
    landlord. But there is no clause in the lease forbidding me
    from putting up my sale announcement beside the landlord's. It
    will run:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>THE PUFF ERRATIC.</h2>

    <p><i>The New Statesman</i> contains a letter from Mr. ARNOLD
    BENNETT, disclaiming all responsibility for the publisher's
    official description of his new novel printed on the "jacket"
    or paper cover thereof. It had not been submitted to him for
    approval and he knew nothing of it. Mr. BENNETT is, of course,
    entitled to his protest, but we greatly hope that publishers
    will not be induced thereby to abstain from supplying these
    interesting summaries. If only the method could be applied to
    standard works the results would be even more illuminating. As
    for example:</p>

    <p>"HAMLET."</p>

    <p>This delicious comedy is the romance of the <i>Prince of
    Denmark</i>, which, unlike other romances, begins after his
    marriage: with <i>Polonia</i>, daughter of <i>Horatio</i>, who
    had been previously engaged to both <i>Rosenstern</i> and
    <i>Guildencranz</i>. <i>Hamlet</i>, by joining a troupe of
    strolling players, offends his uncle, the reigning sovereign,
    and is confined in a lunatic asylum.</p>

    <p>Brilliant pictures of society in Copenhagen, Denmark Hill
    and Heligoland alternate with sparkling studies of the inner
    life of a touring company on the Continent.</p>

    <p>"Can a woman love three men?" is the theme of this
    engrossing extravaganza.</p>

    <p>"IDYLLS OF THE KING."</p>

    <p>In a series of exciting episodes, written in fluent heroic
    couplets, the author gives us a thrilling picture of the
    manners and customs of the Court of <i>King Arthur</i>, an
    early British sovereign, whose stately home was situated on the
    Cornish Riviera.</p>

    <p>Owing to the compromising attentions which he pays to
    <i>Elaine</i>, the Lady of Shalott, the <i>King</i> alienates
    the affections of <i>Queen Guinevere</i> and is slain by one of
    his knights, <i>Lancelot</i> by name.</p>

    <p>Winsome women, gallant paladins and mysterious magicians
    throng these fascinating pages, which incidentally throw much
    light on the theological problems discussed by the Knights of
    the Round Table, among whom <i>Merlin</i>, <i>Vivien</i> and
    <i>Enid</i> are especially, prominent.</p>

    <p>"VANITY FAIR."</p>

    <p><i>Major Dobbin</i>, a <i>beau sabreur</i> of irresistible
    charm, is on the point of eloping with <i>Amelia Osborne</i>,
    the wife of a brother-officer, when the Battle of Waterloo
    breaks out and <i>Dobbin</i> is slain. <i>Captain Osborne</i>,
    in the mistaken impression that <i>Amelia</i> has shared her
    betrayer's fate, marries the beautiful <i>Becky Sharp</i> and
    is tried for bigamy, but is acquitted, as <i>Becky Sharp</i> is
    proved to have been already married to an Indian Nabob of the
    name of <i>Crawley</i>. On the death of <i>Crawley</i>,
    <i>Becky</i> marries the <i>Marquis of Steyne</i>, becomes
    deeply religious and dies in the odour of sanctity.</p>

    <p>"Is marriage a failure?" is the problem of this
    kaleidoscopic drama, which is handled with all the author's
    well-known soulful <i>verve</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>"Smith Minor" again.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Apelles fuit carus Alexandro propter comitate.</i>"
        "Apples were dear in the days of Alexander on account of
        the Committee." (? Food Controller.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A resolution was passed requesting the responsible
        local authority to provide thirty new houses in accordance
        with the Local Government Board's scheme. The houses
        required were&mdash;first, those which were unfit for human
        habitation."&mdash;<i>Sussex Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And, to judge by some of the fantastic designs for rural
    cottages published in the newspapers, those are what they will
    probably get.</p>

    <h2>THE REAL DALRYMPLE.</h2>

    <p>You would feel quite uncomfortable if you heard Dalrymple
    talk. He conveys the impression that everything is badly in the
    way and ought to be removed at once. That's his view. Dalrymple
    has no patience with the social system. This includes
    everything, from the washing bill to the House of Commons.</p>

    <p>Dalrymple said the General Election made him impatient. By
    the way, Dalrymple is a fine upstanding personage, with just
    the coloured hair the lady novelists dote on, and eyes in
    harmony; but despite his handsome placid bearing Dalrymple is a
    fire-eater of the hungriest.</p>

    <p>"What you want to do is to make a clean sweep of
    everything," he said. "Money is an anachronism, and in a
    perfectly ordered State would not be required."</p>

    <p>Of course it is no more use arguing with Dalrymple than it
    would be to attempt a controversy on naval affairs with Lord
    Nelson on his pedestal.</p>

    <p>And then there is this about Dalrymple&mdash;you remember
    what some Court poet said concerning Louis THE FOURTEENTH; it
    was to the effect that <i>quand le Roi parle</i>&mdash;well,
    apparently everything and everybody else had to put up the
    shutters. I forget exactly how the thing ran. It is just so
    with Dalrymple. He comes into my room in the City and warms
    himself, though no fire is needed to fan his enthusiasm for
    destruction. The Bolsheviks are peaceable Sunday folk compared
    with him. A Nihilist on a war footing would be considered
    Quaker-like in his symptoms.</p>

    <p>Dalrymple is neck or nothing. He is a whole-hogger even to
    the most indigestible bit of crackling.</p>

    <p>"What we want is a fresh start," he said. "Then you could
    begin anew and everybody would have a chance. Burn things, blow
    them up, leave nothing; then we should see something. Your
    whole scheme is faulty. Your Underground&mdash;" Dalrymple has
    an irritating habit of fathering things on me, which is unfair,
    for, as regards the Tubes, for instance, I am sorry to say I
    have not even a share, and often not as much as a strap.</p>

    <p>"But the Underground is only a bit overcrowded," I ventured
    to say. "It can't help that, you know."</p>

    <p>"It is all wrong," said Dalrymple. "The entire gadget is
    defective. Look at France, look at America, look at Germany and
    Russia and the Jugo-Slavs."</p>

    <p>It was rather breathless work looking at all these nations
    and peoples, but I did my best. Dalrymple is particularly
    strong when it is a question of the Jugo-Slavs, and he always
    gave me the idea that he spent his Saturday afternoons
    enunciating chatty pleasantries in Trafalgar Square and on
    Tower Hill.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;you might just see the finish&mdash;Dalrymple was
    not doing anything of the sort the afternoon that I was out
    house-hunting. Yes, it is true. You will scarcely credit the
    fact that I found any difficulty in tracking down an eligible
    villa, but that is the case.</p>

    <p>The quest took me to a pleasant semi-rural neighbourhood
    where there was room for gardens with the borders edged with
    the nice soft yellow-tinted box, and rose walks, and dainty
    little arbours, and fandangled appurtenances which amateur
    gardeners love with perfect justification.</p>

    <p>And there was Dalrymple. I won't deceive you. I recognised
    him on the other side of a low oak fence. He was wearing an old
    hat of the texture of the bit of headgear which the man who
    impersonates Napoleon at the music-hall doubles up and plays
    tricks with, only Dalrymple's hat had obviously been white and
    was now going green and other colours with wear and tear.</p>

    <p>And wherever Dalrymple went a small cherub in a holland
    frock went too. The cherub would be about five. Dalrymple was
    fashioning a hen-coop out of two or three soap-boxes. Both he
    and the cherub ceased activities when I hailed and approached;
    and I stopped to dinner. Dalrymple told me he rather fancied he
    could wangle me a bungalow.</p>

    <p>"I know the agent chap," he said, as we sampled a very
    pleasant glass of port. "Of course they want to keep it fairly
    dark or we should be swamped. I have taken a lot of trouble
    myself, you know, and am just starting gardening lectures at
    our club."</p>

    <p>So he went on&mdash;the house, his new roses, the hens, the
    jam his wife made, the idea he had for a winter garden in the
    interests of his wife's mother, who could then take the air in
    her Bath-chair.</p>

    <p>"But," I said, "you want to sweep everything away. You aim
    at sending villages like this to pot&mdash;your own word, you
    remember. And then there are the Jugo-Slavs&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Dalrymple winked and handed me the cigars.</p>

    <p>I fancy he is a fraud.</p>

    <h2>DAILY AND MAILY.</h2>

    <p>Mr. Daily burst into the room, slamming the door behind him,
    to find Mr. Maily seated before the fire.</p>

    <p>"Maily, you're not getting things done," he shouted as he
    walked swiftly up and down the Turkey carpet.</p>

    <p>"Only buttoning my spat, Daily," said Mr. Maily. Then he
    too, springing from his chair, walked rapidly to and fro. But
    whereas Mr. Daily chose the route between the window and the
    motto, "Do something else NOW!" Mr. Maily took the line between
    the fireplace and "Keep on keeping on!" for they seldom felt
    compelled to stick to one direction.</p>

    <p>"Maily, I'm worried," exclaimed Mr. Daily in passing.
    "Things seem to be easing down. Even you are not so nimble as
    you were. This silence of the public troubles me&mdash;haven't
    been saying things about us for a long time."</p>

    <p>"Some people even praise us," remarked Mr. Maily, disgust
    mingling with the perspiration on his face.</p>

    <p>"We'll be damned if we put up with praise," Mr. Daily
    declared.</p>

    <p>"We shall. We'd give praise if they'd damn us," said Mr.
    Maily.</p>

    <p>"Never be funny, Maily, if you can help it," warned Mr.
    Daily. Then he remarked wistfully, "If they'd only burn us
    again!"</p>

    <p>"Couldn't we go for the Archbishop of CANTERBURY?" asked Mr.
    Maily. "To be burnt during morning service in a
    cathedral&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, these church-people couldn't be roused, Maily. Too much
    dillydally about them. They'd never fall to it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Daily jabbed his thumb against a white bell-push, and a
    clerk appeared. "Got enough work to do?" asked Mr. Daily.</p>

    <p>"And then some," said the clerk.</p>

    <p>"Well, get on with it," shouted Mr. Daily impatiently, and
    pressed a red bell-push.</p>

    <p>"Plenty doing?" he asked the compositor who appeared.</p>

    <p>"Twice that," said the compositor.</p>

    <p>"Then go to it," barked Mr. Daily. Turning to behold Mr.
    Maily mopping his brow, he cried, "For heaven's sake don't let
    anybody see you standing still, Maily."</p>

    <p>"I was only thinking," said Mr. Maily.</p>

    <p>"Whatever for?" asked Mr. Daily.</p>

    <p>"Do you suppose&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Suppose nothing. Know!"</p>

    <p>"How would it be to&mdash;to denounce beer?" asked Mr.
    Maily.</p>

    <p>"Gad, but you've still got pluck," said Mr. Daily with
    something like admiration. "They'd burn us right enough. But
    there is such a thing as too much pluck, Maily. Think again, if
    you must think."</p>

    <p>"No," Mr. Daily went on, "I doubt if a satisfactory burning
    can be worked&mdash;it only comes by accident. Meanwhile, if
    the public won't talk about us, we must boom ourselves;" and he
    sprinted to a yellow bell-push to summon the editor.</p>

    <p>"This peace business," said Mr. Daily to him&mdash;"<i>Peace
    must be signed!</i> How's that for a new stunt? Cut out 'The
    Soldiers' Paper' and call ourselves 'The Paper that gets
    Peace.' Get the boys together, work out a scheme and come and
    show us in half-an-hour."</p>

    <p>"But, Daily, is there any likelihood of peace not being
    signed?" asked Mr. Maily, when the editor had gone.</p>

    <p>"For goodness' sake, Maily, pull yourself together. Don't
    you understand that one of the principles of our job is to back
    certs?" said Mr. Daily.</p>

    <h2>A LITTLE FAVOUR.</h2>

    <p>Maisie was terribly upset when she lost her gold curb bangle
    (with padlock attached) between the hospital and the canteen.
    The first I knew of it was seeing a handbill offering two
    pounds' reward on our front gate, with the ink still damp, when
    I came home to lunch. There was a similar bill blowing down the
    road. My wife had some more under her arm and she pressed them
    on me. "Run round to the shops," she said; "get them put right
    in the middle of the windows where they'll catch everybody's
    eye."</p>

    <p>The first shop I entered was a hosier's. Since drilling in
    the V.T.O. I have acquired rather a distinguished bearing.
    Shopkeepers invariably treat me with attention. The hosier
    hurried forward, obviously anticipating a princely order for
    tweeds at war prices. I hadn't the courage to buy nothing. I
    selected the nearest thing on the counter, a futurist necktie
    at two-and-six-three, and, as I was leaving the shop, turned
    back carelessly. "By the by, would you mind putting this bill
    in your window?" I said.</p>

    <p>His lip curled. "This is a high-class business. We make it a
    rule&mdash;no bills," he said.</p>

    <p>At the butcher's next door there were several customers.
    They all gave way to me. I made purchases worthy of my
    appearance and carriage, half an ox tail and some chitterlings.
    Then I proffered a handbill. The man in blue accepted it and,
    before I had opened my lips, returned it to me wrapped round
    the ox tail. I was too taken aback to explain. In fact, when he
    held out his hand, I mechanically gave him another bill for the
    chitterlings.</p>

    <p>At the next shop, a fancy draper's, I acted with cunning. In
    the centre of the window, on a raised background of silver
    paper, was displayed a wreath of orange-blossom veiled with
    tulle. I bought it. The young ladies were hysterical. "May I
    ask permission to put this little handbill in its place?" I
    said. They appealed to the shopwalker. "In the absence of the
    head of the firm I cannot see my way to accede to your
    request," he said. "At present he is on the Rhine. On his
    demobilisation I will place the matter before him if you will
    leave the bill in my hands." I left it.</p>

    <p>I skipped a gramophone emporium and a baby-linen shop and
    entered a fishmonger's. Here I adopted tactics of absolute
    candour. "Look here," I said, "I haven't come to buy anything.
    I don't want any fish, flesh or red-herring, but I should be no
    end grateful if you would stick this bill up for me
    somewhere."</p>

    <p>"Certainly, Sir, as many as you like," said the proprietor
    heartily.</p>

    <p>Gleefully I gave him two. One he stuck on a hook on top of a
    couple of ducks, and it flopped over face downwards on their
    breasts. The other he laid in the middle of the marble counter,
    and the next moment his assistant came along and slapped an
    outsize halibut on it.</p>

    <h2><i>APR&Egrave;S LA GUERRE</i>.</h2>

    <p>"<i>On ne sait jamais le dessous des cartes</i>," as the
    perplexing dialect of the aborigines of this country would put
    it. William and I, when we used to discuss after-the-war
    prospects o' nights in the old days, were more or less resigned
    to a buckshee year or two of filling shell-holes up and pulling
    barbed wire down. Instead of which we all go about the country
    taking in each others' education. No one, we gather, will be
    allowed to go home until he has taken his B.A. with honours.
    And after that&mdash;But it would be better to begin at the
    beginning.</p>

    <p>It began within ten days of the signing of the armistice,
    assuming the shape of an official inquiry from Division, a
    five-barred document wherein somebody with a talent for
    confusing himself (and a great contempt for the Paper
    Controller) managed to ask every officer the same question in
    five different ways. They cancelled each other out after a
    little examination and left behind merely a desire to discover
    whether or not each officer had a job waiting for him on his
    return to civil life. William and I took the thing at a gallop,
    stuck down a succinct "Yes. Yes, No, No. Yes," subscribed our
    signatures and returned the documents&mdash;or so William
    proposed to do&mdash;"for your information and necessary
    inaction."</p>

    <p>"They're getting deuced heavy about these jobs, aren't
    they?" observed William a day or two later. "The Old Man wants
    to see us all at orderly-room for a private
    interview&mdash;he's got to make a return showing whether his
    officers have got jobs waiting for them, if not, why not, and
    please indent at once to make good any deficiencies. Hullo,
    what's this?"</p>

    <p>It happened to be William's mail for the day&mdash;one large
    official-looking envelope. It turned out to be a document from
    his old unit (he had entered the Army from an O.T.C.), headed,
    "Resettlement and Employment of ex-Officers: Preliminary
    Enquiry." It was a formidable catechism, ranging from inquiries
    as to whether William had a job ready for him to a request for
    a signed statement from his C.O. certifying that he was a
    sober, diligent and obliging lad and had generally given every
    satisfaction in his present situation. In case he hadn't a job
    or wanted another one there were convenient spaces in which to
    confess the whole of his past&mdash;whether he had a liking for
    animals or the Colonies, mechanical aptitude (if any), down to
    full list of birth-marks and next-of-kin. William thrust the
    thing hastily into the stove. But I observed that there was a
    cloud over him for the rest of the day.</p>

    <p>However, we both of us satisfied the examiner at the
    orderly-room, though the renewed evidence of a determined
    conspiracy to find work for him left William a trifle more
    thoughtful than his wont. Shades of the prison-house began to
    close about our growing joy, "These 'ere jobs," remarked
    William, "are going to take a bit of dodging, dearie. Looks to
    me as though you might cop out for anything from a tram-driver
    to Lord Chief. Wish people wouldn't be so infernally obliging.
    And, anyway, what is this&mdash;an Army or a Labour
    Exchange?"</p>

    <p>As the days wore on the strain became more and more intense.
    William's old school had contrived an association which begged
    to be allowed to do anything in the world for him except leave
    him for a single day in idleness. And what time the Army was
    not making inquiries about his own civil intentions and
    abilities it was insisting on his extracting the same
    information from the platoons. William grew haggard and morose.
    He began looking under his bed every night for prospective
    employers and took to sleeping with a loaded Webley under his
    pillow for fear of being kidnapped by a registry office. He
    slept in uneasy snatches, and when he did doze off was
    tormented by hideous nightmares.</p>

    <p>In one of them he dreamt he was on leave and walking through
    the City. At every doorway he had to run the gauntlet of lithe
    and implacable managing directors, all ready to pounce on him,
    drag him within and chain him permanently to a stool&mdash;with
    the complete approval of the Army Council. In another he was
    appearing before a tribunal of employers as a conscientious
    objector to all forms of work.</p>

    <p>The last straw was when the Brigadier caused it to be made
    known that if any officer was particularly unsettled about his
    future he might be granted a personal interview and it would be
    seen what could be done for him. William sat down with the air
    of one who has established a thumping bridgehead over his
    Rubicon and wrote to the Brigadier direct and as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"SIR,&mdash;I have the honour to hope that this finds you a
    good deal better than it leaves me at present. In case you
    should be in any uncertainty over your prospects on return to
    half-pay, I shall be happy to grant you a personal interview at
    my billet (Sheet 45; G 22a 3.7.) and see whether anything can
    be arranged to suit you. I may add that I have a number of
    excellent appointments on my books, from knife-boy to traveller
    to a firm of mineral water manufacturers. For my own part my
    immediate future is firmly settled, thank you. For at least
    three months after my discharge from the Army I have no
    intention of taking up any form of work.</p>

    <p>"I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

    <p>"YOUR OTHERWISE OBEDIENT SERVANT, ETC."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The court-martial was held last Thursday and sentence will
    be promulgated any day now. Medical evidence certified William
    as sane enough to understand the nature of his offence, but as
    the War is over it is unlikely that he will be shot at dawn.
    William himself is confident that he will be cashiered, a
    sentence which carries with it automatic and permanent
    exclusion from all appointments under the Crown. "That makes a
    tidy gap in the wire," says William hopefully. "They won't even
    be able to make a postman of me. With a bit of luck I'll dodge
    the unofficial jobs&mdash;I get that holiday after all, old
    bean."</p>

    haybox cookery, and during the process will publicly skin a
    ration rabbit in such a way that not the slightest depreciation
    is caused in the value of 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> attached to a
    rabbit-skin.</p>

    <p>The Officer i/e Demobilisation will demobilise you while you
    wait (provided you can wait long enough).</p>

    <p>The Quartermaster will make a model of Hampton Court Maze,
    illustrative of the intricacies of his department, taking care
    that his model appropriately differs from the original in
    having no means of exit.</p>

    <p>The Medical Officer will demonstrate how the huge national
    accumulation of No. 9 pills may be adapted to civilian purposes
    by using the pill <i>(a)</i> as a fertiliser for the Officers'
    tennis lawn, and <i>(b)</i> as a destroyer of the superfluous
    grass bordering thereon.</p>

    <p>Company Commanders will collaborate in a display of standing
    on their own feet without the assistance of their respective
    Company Sergeant-Majors. (N.B.&mdash;Absolute silence is

    <h2>WINCHESTER'S OPPORTUNITY.</h2>

    <p>War legislation has pressed hard on many callings, and on
    none more than that of the architect. But the embargo has been
    lifted; the ancient art is coming to its own again, and it is
    of happy omen that the new President of the Royal Academy has
    been chosen from the architects. In this context we welcome the
    stimulating article in a recent issue of <i>The Times</i>
    <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the Winchester War Memorial. "Are we
    never," asks the writer, "to take risks in our architecture?"
    and his answer, briefly summed up, is "Perish the thought.
    <i>De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace.</i>"
    It is, of course, a pity that the Winchester War Memorial
    scheme has not met with the unanimous approval of Wykehamists.
    Possibly they have reason, for while adding a new cloister, a
    new gateway and a new hall to the existing school buildings, it
    involves the pulling down of the Quingentenary Memorial
    Building, erected some twenty years ago, and of some old houses
    in Kingsgate Street. Some consider such a drastic destruction
    to be unfortunate, but, says <i>The Times</i>, it is "necessary
    if any scheme worthy of the occasion is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> to be carried out."
       Moreover it is proposed to re-erect the Quingentenary
       Memorial on a new site, "where it will certainly look as
       well as ever."</p>

    <p>The greatest event in our history, as the writer finely
    observes, cannot be worthily commemorated by any timid
    compromise. Winchester has set a splendid example, but it is
    perhaps too much to expect that it will be followed by London,
    owing to the inevitable clash of conflicting interests in our
    unwieldy metropolis. The erection of a new Pantheon on the site
    of St. Paul's and the removal of WREN'S massive but
    <i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;</i> structure to Hampstead Heath, where
    it would certainly look as well as ever, is, we fear, however
    much <i>The Times</i> may desire it, beyond the range of
    practical politics. But example is infectious, and if only the
    Winchester authorities would expand their scheme and carry it
    out with Dantonesque audacity to its full logical conclusion,
    other towns and cities might ultimately fall into line.</p>

    <p>Winchester Cathedral, as we need hardly remind our readers,
    has only been rescued from subsidence and collapse at an
    immense cost by a lavish use of the resources of modern
    engineering. The building itself is not without merits, but its
    site is inconspicuous and the swampy nature of the soil is a
    constant menace to its durability. The scheme which we venture
    with all humility to suggest is that it should be removed and
    re-erected, in the same spirit though in the architectural
    language of our own day, on the summit of St. Catherine's Hill,
    where it would look better than ever, and be connected by a
    scenic neo-Gothic railway with Meads. This would not only add
    to the amenities of the landscape, but enable the present
    cathedral site to be utilized for a purpose more in consonance
    with the needs of the age. We do not presume to dictate, but
    may point out that if the deanery and the canons' houses were
    pulled down and re-erected on the golf-links, where they would
    look better than ever, space would be available for a majestic
    aerodrome, or, better still, an experimental water-stadium for
    submarines, in memory of KING ALFRED, the founder of our
    Fleet.</p>

    <p>Into the question of details, design and cost it is not for
    us to enter. We confine ourselves to appealing with all the
    force at our command to Winchester, fortunate, as <i>The
    Times</i> reminds us, in the choice of an architect of genius
    and ingenuity, to persevere, to rise to the occasion, to cast
    compromise to the winds and above all to remember that the
    greatest compliment which can be paid to the architects of the
    past is to remove their buildings to sites where they look
    better than ever and do not suffer from the immediate
    neighbourhood of the masterpieces of their successors.
    Architecture has been defined as "frozen music." But on great
    occasions such as this it needs to be taken out of its
    cold-storage and judiciously thawed.</p>

    <h2>CIVIL EDUCATION FOR SOLDIERS.</h2>

    <p>When the armistice was signed and the close season for
    Germans set in, it occurred to the authorities that it would be
    a waste of labour to continue to train some few million good
    men for a shooting season that might never re-open, and the
    weekly programme became rather a sketchy affair till some brain
    more brilliant than the rest conceived the idea of giving a
    good sound education in the arts of peace to this promising and
    waiting multitude. The idea was joyfully accepted, and
    gradually filtered through its authorised channels, suffering
    some office change or other at each stage till it finally
    reached one of our ancient seats of learning. It arrived rather
    like the peremptory order of a newly-gazetted and bewildered
    subaltern, who, having got his platoon hopelessly tied up,
    falls back on the time-honoured and usually infallible "Carry
    on, Sergeant."</p>

    <p>There were some six-hundred white-hatted cadets stationed at
    this spot, all thirsting (presumably) for information on gas,
    and Mills bombs, and studs on the cocking-piece, and forming
    fours, and vertical intervals and District Courts-martial; and
    when the order came to "carry on" with education it caused
    something like a panic. A council of war nearly caused
    Head-quarters to cancel a battalion parade, but they pulled
    themselves together and held the drill, and the appointed Jack
    as "Battalion Education Officer," and empowered him to draft a
    scheme of work.</p>

    <p>When produced it consisted of fourteen paragraphs, each of
    which finished up with the sentence, "This is obviously a
    problem for the Company Commander." Jack had nothing to learn
    as to the duties of a battalion specialist and realised that
    his responsibility lay simply in providing Company Commanders,
    and then finding problems for them to solve. As the Company
    Commanders were already in being his work was simplified.</p>

    <p>However, the Company Commanders, being men of merit,
    cheerfully accepted the situation and approached their victims.
    "We are going to teach you," they said. "What would you like to
    be taught?"</p>

    <p>"Well," said the victims, "what have you got?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, anything you like," said the Company Commanders. "Just
    you choose your subject and we'll do the rest."</p>

    <p>Now that was very generous, but rather rash. For the victims
    took them at their word, and so by the time the perspiring
    Platoon Commanders had produced their returns (in triplicate)
    it was found that there were forty-three subjects to be
    provided for, including seven languages, six branches of
    science, four kinds of engineering, six commercial subjects and
    various sundries, such as metaphysics, wool-classing and
    coker-nut planting.</p>

    <p>The way the Company Commanders dealt with this problem was
    quite simple and ingenious. They sent for all junior officers
    and asked what they were prepared to teach. The result seemed
    really rather good. Tom said he would take French, having spent
    three months in Northern France before they sent him to
    Salonika. Dick's father has an allotment and Dick himself
    occasionally hunts, so he chose Agriculture, Oswald chose
    Mathematics, on the strength of having been a
    Quartermaster-Sergeant in the Public Schools Brigade in
    September, 1914. Wilfred once went to a gas course for ten
    days, so of course his subject was Science. Arthur really does
    know something about Architecture and can also enlarge a map
    quite nicely, so he put down Drawing. John chose Theology. He
    said he once read the lessons in church; really he thought he
    was safe to draw a blank.</p>

    <p>Once more the Company Commanders were equal to the
    emergency. They looked at it in this way. French is a foreign
    language; Spanish is also a foreign language. Tom offers to
    teach a foreign language; therefore Tom shall teach Spanish.
    Corn-growing in Western Canada, sheep-raising in Australia and
    coker-nut planting are all obviously agriculture. Dick says he
    can teach Agriculture; so he shall. The science of manures
    caused some discussion as to whether it should be agriculture
    or science, but it was finally settled in favour of science,
    which also included physics, electricity and crystallography.
    John got four theological students, but, when he investigated,
    he found that one was a Jew and one a Presbyterian minister,
    while the other two, like himself, thought that no one else
    would have thought of it. And these touch only the fringe of
    the subject.</p>

    <p>The indent sent in for materials was a rather formidable
    one, but the article most in demand was a sheep, which was
    wanted at the same time by Dick for his Agriculture and Arthur
    for his Drawing, and also by Mac, who is O.C. the Butchery
    class. Mac wrote a polite little note saying he must have at
    least one a week, and he'd like "a pig to be going on with, if
    you please," promising to hand, the latter over complete and in
    good order, when he'd done with it, to Jones for his
    bacon-curing class, "upon receipt of signature for same."</p>

    <h2>THE FOOD PROBLEM IN PARIS.</h2>

    <p>The cost of living in the vicinity of the Peace Conference
    has been enormously exaggerated. Likewise the difficulty of
    reorganizing Europe on a truly ethnic basis. By combining the
    two questions I have found them immensely simplified, and I
    have been in Paris only three days.</p>

    <p>My meaning will be clearly illustrated by the record of a
    single day's experience&mdash;with the representative of the
    Dodopeloponnesians for <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> and the
    delegate of the Pan-Deuteronomaniads for dinner.</p>

    <p>I made the acquaintance of the first in the lift. On the way
    down it came out that I was <i>journaliste</i> assisting at the
    Conference of the Peace, whereupon the other introduced himself
    as secretary of the Dodopeloponnesian delegation and eager for
    the pleasure of entertaining me at
    <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>.</p>

    <p>Nothing international arose in connection with the <i>hors
    d'oeuvres</i>. It was between the soup and the fish that my
    host inquired whether I had yet found time to look into the
    just claim of the Dodopeloponnesian people to the neighbouring
    island of Funicula.</p>

    <p>"You mean," I said, "on the ground that the island of
    Funicula was brought under the Dodopeloponnesian sceptre on
    September 11th, 1405, by Blagoslav the Splay-fingered, from
    whom it was wrested on February 3rd, 1406, by the Seljuks?"</p>

    <p>"Precisely," he said. "But also because the people of
    Funicula are originally of Dodopeloponnesian stock."</p>

    <p>"Yet they speak the language of Pan-Deuteronomania," I
    said.</p>

    <p>"A debased dialect," he said, "foisted upon them by a
    remission of ten per cent. in taxes for every hundred words of
    the lingo learned by heart, with double votes for irregular
    verbs."</p>

    <p>The <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, something with eggs and jelly, was
    excellent.</p>

    <p>"Far be it from me to deny," I said, "the fact that Funicula
    is by right a part of the inheritance of the
    Octo-syllabarians"&mdash;and I bowed gracefully to my host, who
    raised his glass in return&mdash;"and I agree in advance with
    every argument you put forward in favour of a restored
    Sesquicentennial commonwealth by bringing together the
    scattered members of the Duodecimal race from all over the
    world. In fact," I added as the waiter poured out the
    champagne, "it seems to me that in addition to the Island of
    Funicula there properly belongs, in the realm of your Greater
    Anti-Vivisectoria, the adjacent promontory, geyser and natural
    bridge of Pneumobronchia, from which the last Seljuk ruler,
    Didyffius the Forty-fifth, leaped in front of a machete wielded
    by his eldest son, who therefore became Didymus the
    Forty-sixth."</p>

    <p>He was delighted to find so much sympathy and understanding
    in an alien journalist from far across the seas. His bill, so
    far as a hurried and discreet glance could reveal, was 89
    francs 50 centimes, not including the <i>taxe</i>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the <i>sous-secr&eacute;taire</i> of the
    Pan-Deuteronomaniad delegation, who took me out to dinner that
    same night, paid 127 francs (including theatre tickets) before
    he proved to my satisfaction that the basic civilization of
    Funicula Island is after all Pan-whatever-you-call-it.</p>

    <p>At any rate my point is made. My expenditure on food these
    three days in Paris has been negligible, and there is rumour
    that the Supra-Zambesian delegation is thinking of opening a
    hotel with running water, h. and c., in every room.</p>

    <h2>ROMANCE WHILE YOU WAIT.</h2>

    <p>My friend and I occupied facing seats in a railway-carriage
    on a tedious journey. Having nothing to read and not much to
    say, I gazed through the windows at the sodden English winter
    landscape, while my friend's eyes were fixed on the opposite
    wall of the compartment, above my head.</p>

    <p>"What a country!" I exclaimed at last. "Good heavens, what a
    country, to spend one's life in!"</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, withdrawing his eyes from the space above my
    head. "And why do we stay in it when there are such glorious
    paradises to go to? Hawaii now. If you really want divine
    laziness&mdash;sun and warmth and the absence of all fretful
    ambition&mdash;you should go to the South Seas. You can't get
    it anywhere else. I remember when I was in Hawaii&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Hawaii!" I interrupted. "You never told me you had been to
    Hawaii."</p>

    <p>"I don't tell everything," he replied. "But the happiest
    hours of my existence were spent in a little village two or
    three miles from Honolulu, on the coast, where we used to go
    now and then for a day's fun. It was called&mdash;let me get it
    right&mdash;it was called Tormo Tonitui&mdash;and there were
    pleasure-gardens there and the most fascinating girls." His
    eyes took on a far-away wistfulness.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes?" I said.</p>

    <p>"Fascinating brown girls," he said, "who played that
    banjo-mandolin thing they all play, and sang mournful luxurious
    songs, and danced under the lanterns at night. And the bathing!
    There's no bathing here at all. There you can stay in the sea
    air day if you like. It's like bathing in champagne. Sun and
    surf and sands&mdash;there's nothing like it." He sighed
    rapturously.</p>

    <p>"Well, I can't help saying again," I interrupted, "that it's
    a most extraordinary thing that, after knowing you all these
    years, you have never told me a word about Honolulu or the
    South Seas or this wonderful pleasure-garden place
    called&mdash;what was the name of it?"</p>

    <p>He hesitated for a moment. "Morto Notitui," he then
    replied.</p>

    <p>"I don't think that's how you had it before," I said;
    "surely it was Tormo Tonitui?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it was," he said. "I forget. Those Hawaiian names
    are very much alike and all rather confusing. But you really
    ought to go out there. Why don't you cut everything for a year
    and get some sunshine into your system? You're fossilising
    here. We all are. Let's be gamblers and chance it."</p>

    <p>"I wish I could," I said. "Tell me some more about your life
    there."</p>

    <p>"It was wonderful," he went on&mdash;wonderful. I'm not
    surprised that STEVENSON found it a paradise."</p>

    <p>"By the way," I asked, "did you hear anything of
    STEVENSON?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes, lots. I met several men who had known
    him&mdash;Tusitala he was called there, you know&mdash;and
    several natives. There was one extraordinary old fellow who had
    helped him make the road up the mountain. He and I had some
    great evenings together, yarning and drinking copra."</p>

    <p>"Did he tell you anything particularly personal about
    STEVENSON?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Nothing that I remember," he said; "but he was a fine old
    fellow and as thirsty as they make 'em."</p>

    <p>"What is copra like?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Great," he said. "Like&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;well,
    like Audit ale and Veuve Clicquot mixed. But it got to your
    head. You had to be careful. I remember one night after a day's
    bathing at&mdash;at Tromo Titonui&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Where was that?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that little village I was telling you about," he said.
    "I remember one night&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Look here," I said, "you began by calling it Tormo Tonitui,
    then you called it Morto Notitui and now it's Tromo Titonui.
    I'm going to say again, quite seriously, that I don't believe
    you ever were in Hawaii at all."</p>

    <p>"Of course I wasn't," he replied. "But what is one to do in
    a railway carriage, with nothing to read, and a drenched world
    and those two words staring one in the face?" and he pointed to
    a placard above my head advertising a firm which provided the
    best and cheapest Motor Tuition.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>MR. ARNOLD BENNETT'S new novel, <i>The Roll Call</i>
    (HUTCHINSON), is a continuation of the <i>Clayhanger</i> series
    to the extent that its hero, <i>George Cannon</i>, is the
    stepson of <i>Edwin</i>, who himself makes a perfunctory
    appearance at the close of the tale. The scene is, however, now
    London, where we watch <i>George</i> winning fame and fortune,
    quite in the masterful Five-Towns manner, as an architect. The
    change is, I think, beneficial. That quality of unstalable
    astonishment, native to Mr. BENNETT's folk, accords better with
    the complexities of the wonderful city than to places where it
    had at times only indifferent matter upon which to work. But it
    is noticeable that Mr. BENNETT can communicate this surprise
    not only to his characters but to his readers. There is an
    enthusiasm, real or apparent, in his art which, like the beam
    celestial, "evermore makes all things new," so that when he
    tells us, as here, that there are studios in Chelsea or that
    the lamps in the Queen's Hall have red shades, these facts
    acquire the thrill of sudden and almost startling discovery. I
    suppose this to be one reason for the pleasure that I always
    have in his books; another is certainly the intense, even
    passionate sympathy that he lavishes upon the central
    character. In the present example the affairs of <i>George
    Cannon</i> are shown developing largely under the stimulus of
    four women, of whom the least seen is certainly the most
    interesting, while <i>Lois</i>, the masterful young female whom
    <i>George</i> marries, promises as a personality more than she
    fulfils. We conduct <i>George's</i> fortunes as far as the
    crisis produced in them by the War, and leave him contemplating
    a changed life as a subaltern in the R.F.A. It is therefore
    permissible to hope that in a year or two we may expect the
    story of his reconstruction. I shall read it with delight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Iron Times with the Guards</i> (MURRAY), by an O.E., is
    emphatically one of the books which one won't turn out from
    one's war-book shelf. It fills in blanks which appear in more
    ambitious and more orderly narratives. This particular old
    Etonian, entering the new Army by way of the Territorials in
    the first days of the War, was transferred, in the March of
    1915, to the Coldstreams and was in the fighting line in April
    of the same year. A way they had in the Army of those great
    days. Details of the routine of training, reported
    barrack-square jests and dug-out conversations, vignettes of
    trench and field, disquisitions on many strictly relevant and
    less relevant topics, reflections of that fine pride in the
    regiment which marks the best of soldiers, an occasional more
    ambitious survey of a battle or a campaign&mdash;all this from
    a ready but not pretentious pen, guided by a sound intelligence
    and some power of observation, makes an admirable commentary.
    Our author's narrative carries us to those days of the great
    hopes of the Spring of 1917, hopes so tragically deferred.
    Perhaps the best thing in an interesting sheaf is the
    description of the attack of the Guards Division&mdash;as it
    had become&mdash;on the Transloy-Lesboeufs-Ginchy road, with
    its glory and its carnage.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is to be feared that <i>Battle Days</i> (BLACKWOOD), a
    new <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> work by Mr. ARTHUR
       FETTERLESS, author of <i>Gog</i>, will lose a good many
       readers as the result of the armistice. There are battle
       stories and battle books that are not stories that will live
       far into the piping times of peace because they are human
       documents or have the stamp of genius. These attractions are
       not present in <i>Battle Days</i>, which in truth is rather
       a prosy affair, though ambitious withal. It is not fiction
       in the ordinary sense. Mr. FETTERLESS essays to conduct the
       reader through every phase of a big "Push." Pushes were
       complicated affairs, and the author does not spare us many
       of the complications. And unless the reader happens to be an
       ardent militarist he is apt to push off into slumberland.
       Cadets should be made to read this book as a matter of
       instruction; for, though it lacks the subtle humour that
       endeared <i>Duffer's Drift</i> to us, it provides a striking
       analysis of modern trench warfare.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Curtain of Steel</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) is the
    fourth book which the author of <i>In the Northern Mists</i>
    has given us during the War, and in essentials it is the most
    valuable of the quartette. For here we have real history,
    served, it is true, with some trimmings, but none the less a
    true record of the doings of our Grand Fleet since the day when
    the "curtain" was lowered. "Nothing," our author says,
    "nauseates a naval man so much as the attempt to represent him
    as a hero or to theatricalise him and his profession." It
    behoves me then to choose my words with the utmost
    circumspection, and I beg him to forgive my audacity when I say
    that, if I were Book-Controller, a copy of <i>The Curtain of
    Steel</i> would be in (and out of) the library of every school
    in the Empire. I find courage to make this statement because I
    see that he does not deny that a part of our "disease of
    ignorance" concerning the Senior Service is due to the modesty
    of Naval men. If he will please go on correcting that
    ignorance, and in the same inspiring style, I wish an even
    greater access of power to his elbow.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"I am allowed the reputation of a tolerable guide in writing
    and style, and I can certainly help you to produce clear
    English." These words, written in 1881, are to be found in a
    letter of GEORGE MEREDITH to his eldest son. They show how
    wildly mistaken even the best of us may be with regard to our
    own qualities and gifts; for if there is one thing that
    MEREDITH could not produce, that thing is clear English. Mr.
    S.M. ELLIS agrees with me in this particular point, and has
    written <i>George Meredith: His Life and Friends in Relation to
    his Work</i> (GRANT RICHARDS) to prove that this is so. The
    book is a curious compound. At one moment Mr. ELLIS sets out in
    detail the Meredithian genealogy, and shows that MEREDITH was
    the son and grandson of tailors and did not relish the
    relationship; at another moment he describes MEREDITH'S
    delightful and exuberantly youthful characteristics as a
    friend; and again he shows how badly MEREDITH behaved in regard
    to his first wife (though she was much more in fault), and also
    in regard to his first son, Arthur. Still the book is extremely
    interesting and, though it does not profess to deal in
    elaborate criticism, it contains some very shrewd comments on
    MEREDITH'S work and the reasons that made his novels so many
    sealed books to the British public. Here and there Mr. ELLIS
    allows himself almost to write a passage or two in the style of
    the master. This is one of them: "As he [Maurice Fitzgerald]
    was the gourmetic instrument that brought Mrs. Ockenden's art
    to perfect expression, he appropriately attained
    immortalisation jointly with her at the hands of the friend who
    had shared with him the joys of that good woman's superlative
    cookery in Seaford days."</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
